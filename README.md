civic-hackers-happy-hour
========================

On Tuesday, July23rd, some amazing folks are being honored for their roles in the Open Government and Civic Hacking movements at a Champions of Change event at the White House.

Code for Tulsa is honored that our OpenFEMA Urban Search & Rescue project from the National Day of Civic Hacking (NDoCH)was selected to participate in these festivities.

Code for Tulsa also knows that:
1.  There are more people doing awesome things in the open government/civic hacking space than could ever be recognized at the Champions of Change event.
2.	Some of the best connections/opportunities come out of informal events where people can relax and blow off a little steam.

So we decided to host a happy hour that would include open government/civic hacking folks in and around the greater DC area and give all the Champions of Change attendees a chance to blow off a little steam the night before the big day.

Our vision turned into reality when our friends over at Mozilla, who are big supporters of open government/civic hacking, offered to sponsor it. So with the generous support of Mozilla, we are planning to have an assortment of tasty food, some local craft beers and a few other cold beverages to get the conversation started.

In order to continue the conversations from our Happy Hour, Code for Tulsa has “hacked” this GitHub repository to serve as a place for attendees to connect as “Collaborators” on this “project”.  We encourage you to browse the other “Collaborators”, review their Profiles and follow/connect with them with the intention of further growing this awesome community that is rapidly evolving. We are honored to have so many “Rock Stars” attending our event and we know the entire community can learn a lot by seeing what other repositories they are Forking and/or Committing to.

Additionally feel free to add “Issues” for purposes of discussion etc or to edit CONTRIBUTORS.md with your name.

Thank you again we are honored to share this opportunity with so many amazing people doing so many amazing things.
